# Bio
I’m a 15 year old femboy from Texas. I play video games, mostly Geometry Dash. I’m also into video game programming. I know JavaScript and I’m planning to learn C++ when I feel like it. I haven’t worked on any big games yet but I have a few ideas for an RPG, not 100% sure if I’ll actually be able to produce it though.
